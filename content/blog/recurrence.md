Today, we released a new feature for Ultralist - Recurrence!

Tasks can now recur on a variety of cadences.  This oft-requested feature is now implemented!

A few examples:

```
ultralist add daily standup recur:weekdays
ultralist add concentrate on deliverables for +project recur:daily until:nov12
ultralist edit 3 recur:monthly
```

[See the docs on recurrence.](docs/cli/recurrence/)
